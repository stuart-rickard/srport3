        I'm very interested generally in how humans can use technology to
        improve their lives. Specifically to coding, I love user interfaces that
        are highly intuitive for beginners and also provide a path for more
        powerful use that unfolds as the user spends time working with the
        interface. I find these interfaces very elegant, and I really appreciate
        elegant coding also.

        For thirty years I worked in the real estate development business; since
        2003 as a real estate entrepreneur running my own business. Real estate
        development has many aspects that are similar to software development:
        collaboration, creativity, and a hopefully durable product, to name
        three. Since I was a child, I've loved coding, and I'm very excited to
        be able to work in coding now.
