      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I'm interested in technology and how we can use technology to improve
        our lives. This is a complex challenge that humans have always contended
        with. I enjoy being part of a coding community that is working to
        provide solutions to this challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        I appreciate and try to create: intuitive user interfaces, interesting
        visual design, and easy-to-read code.
      </p>

        I'm an experienced real estate developer and have owned my own business
        since 2003. Collaboration and creativity are similarly valued in real
        estate development as they are in software development.
