      <h1>About</h1>
      <p>
        I'm interested in technology and how we can use technology to improve
        people's lives. This is a complex challenge. I enjoy being part of a
        coding community that is helping to provide solutions to this challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        I appreciate and I strive to create: intuitive user interfaces,
        interesting visual design, and easy-to-read code.
      </p>

        I am an experienced real estate development entrepreneur; I have owned
        my own business since 2003. I highly value collaboration and creativity,
        skills I have found are key to success in both real estate development
        and software development.
